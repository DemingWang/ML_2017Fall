Since each image has 28 by 28 pixels, we get a 28x28 array. We can flatten 
each array into a 28∗28=78428∗28=784 dimensional vector. 
Each component of the vector is a value between zero and one describing the 
intensity of the pixel. 
Thus, we generally think of MNIST as being a collection of 784-dimensional vectors.
